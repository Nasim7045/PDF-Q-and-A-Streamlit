PDF Question-Answer Assistant
This application allows users to upload PDF files, extract the text from them, and ask questions about the content using a Generative AI model powered by Google Gemini. The app uses Streamlit for the front-end interface, PyMuPDF for extracting text from PDFs, and the Google Generative AI API for answering user queries.

Features
PDF Upload: Users can upload a PDF file to extract its text.
Text Extraction: The app extracts text from the uploaded PDF file using PyMuPDF.
Question-Answer: Users can input questions related to the content of the uploaded PDF, and the app generates AI responses.
Generative AI: The app uses Google Gemini for generating responses based on the uploaded content.
Prerequisites
To run this application, you will need:

Python 3.7 or higher
A Google Generative AI API Key (for interacting with Googleâ€™s Generative AI model)
Streamlit, PyMuPDF, and other required Python libraries.
Installation
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-question-answer-assistant.git
cd pdf-question-answer-assistant
2. Install required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up your Google Generative AI API key:
To interact with the Google Generative AI model, you must provide an API key. Replace the following line in the code with your actual API key:

python
Copy code
api_key = "set your api key here"  # Replace with your actual API key
Note: You should not hardcode your API key in production. Instead, use environment variables or a secrets management system.

4. Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run pdf_QA_app.py
This will start the app, and you can access it by navigating to the URL provided by Streamlit in your terminal.

How to Use
Upload a PDF File: Click the "Upload a PDF file" button to select and upload a PDF document.
Ask Questions: After the PDF is uploaded and the text is extracted, input your questions related to the content of the PDF.
Receive AI Responses: The AI will process your question and the PDF text, providing an answer based on the content.

Notes
Security: In production, avoid hardcoding sensitive information (like API keys) directly into the code. Use environment variables or other secure methods to manage secrets.
Limitations: The current version of the app extracts and processes text only. It may not handle PDFs with complex layouts (e.g., tables or images) very well.
Performance: For large PDFs, the text extraction process may take some time depending on the document's size.
