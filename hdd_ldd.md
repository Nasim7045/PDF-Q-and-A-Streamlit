High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) for the PDF Question-Answer Assistant using Streamlit and Google Generative AI
This document outlines the architectural design, both high-level and low-level, of a PDF Question-Answer Assistant. The application enables users to upload a PDF document, extract its text content, and then ask questions about the content using a generative AI model powered by Google Gemini (or similar API-based models).

High-Level Design (HLD)
1. Overview of the System
The application allows users to interact with a PDF document through the following steps:

Upload a PDF: The user uploads a PDF file, which is parsed and its text is extracted.
Text Extraction: The text content of the PDF is extracted using a library (like PyMuPDF).
Question Input: The user can input a question related to the PDF content.
AI Model Response: The AI model (Google Gemini) processes the question with respect to the PDF text and returns an answer.
Display the Result: The application displays the AI's answer to the user.
Error Handling: Errors, such as invalid PDFs or no input question, are handled appropriately.

3. Components
Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly web interface to upload PDFs, input questions, and display AI responses.

st.file_uploader for PDF upload.
st.text_input for user queries.
st.write for displaying answers.
PDF Text Extraction: The system uses PyMuPDF (fitz library) to extract text from the uploaded PDF file.

Generative AI Integration: Google Gemini or any other generative AI model API that processes the question against the extracted PDF text and provides a response.

API Key Configuration: API keys for the generative AI model are hardcoded (for development) or stored securely in environment variables.

Low-Level Design (LLD)
1. Code Components
The system's low-level components and their interactions are described below.

a. API Key Handling
The API key is configured directly in the script (not recommended for production) or passed as an environment variable:

python
Copy code
# Hardcoded API key (Not recommended for production)
api_key = "set your api key here"  # Replace with your actual API key

# Check if the API key is valid
if not api_key:
    st.error("API key is missing. Please hardcode the API key in the script.")
else:
    # Configure Generative AI API
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
b. PDF Text Extraction (fitz library)
The function to extract text from the uploaded PDF is:

python
Copy code
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file):
    text = ""
    pdf_document = fitz.open(stream=pdf_file, filetype="pdf")
    for page_num in range(pdf_document.page_count):
        page = pdf_document.load_page(page_num)
        text += page.get_text()  # Extracts text from the PDF page
    return text
c. Generative AI Model Interaction
The generative AI model is configured with settings for temperature, tokens, etc., and used to answer questions based on the PDF text.

python
Copy code
# Configure generation settings for the model
generation_config = {
    "temperature": 1.2,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "top_k": 50,
    "max_output_tokens": 8192,
    "response_mime_type": "text/plain",
}

# Initialize the GenerativeModel with your configuration
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    model_name="gemini-1.5-flash",
    generation_config=generation_config,
)
chat_session = model.start_chat(history=[])
d. User Interaction (Streamlit UI)
The application uses Streamlit to handle user interactions:

Uploading a PDF: st.file_uploader("Upload a PDF file", type="pdf")
Input for questions: st.text_input("Enter your question about the PDF content:")
Displaying the AI response: st.write("AI Response:", response_text)
The complete flow of the application:

python
Copy code
if uploaded_pdf:
    try:
        # Extract text from PDF
        pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf(uploaded_pdf.read())
        st.success("PDF uploaded and text extracted successfully!")
        
        # Input for questions
        question = st.text_input("Enter your question about the PDF content:")

        if question:
            input_text = f"Here is the text from the PDF:\n\n{pdf_text}\n\nQuestion: {question}"
            response = chat_session.send_message(input_text)
            response_text = response.text

            # Display the response
            st.write("AI Response:", response_text)

            # Save the conversation history
            chat_session.history.append({"role": "user", "parts": [question]})
            chat_session.history.append({"role": "model", "parts": [response_text]})

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"An error occurred while processing the PDF: {e}")
2. Error Handling
PDF Errors: If the PDF cannot be parsed or if it's empty, display an error.
API Key Issues: If the API key is missing or incorrect, the system alerts the user to provide a valid key.
3. Workflow Sequence
User Uploads PDF: Streamlit UI allows the user to upload a PDF file.
Extract Text: The extract_text_from_pdf() function extracts the text from the uploaded file.
User Asks a Question: The user types a question related to the PDF content.
Send to AI Model: The question and the extracted PDF text are sent to the AI model (via the chat_session.send_message()).
Display AI Response: The response from the AI is displayed in the Streamlit interface.
History Tracking: The interaction history is saved and can be reused for future questions.
Conclusion
This system architecture is designed to be modular and scalable. The key components include:

PDF Text Extraction using PyMuPDF (fitz library).
Interaction with Generative AI Models (Google Gemini or similar).
Streamlit for creating a user-friendly interface.
The system can be further extended with additional features, such as multi-page PDF handling, conversation history, advanced query understanding, or the option to fine-tune the AI model for better context handling.
