Source Code Documentation: PDF Question-Answer Assistant
1. Overview
The application enables users to upload PDF files, extract their content, and ask questions about the content using a Generative AI model (powered by Google Gemini). It uses Streamlit for the front-end interface, PyMuPDF (fitz) for extracting text from PDFs, and Google Generative AI for answering user queries related to the PDF content.

2. Imports
python
Copy code
import os
import google.generativeai as genai
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import streamlit as st
os: Provides functions to interact with the operating system, especially for handling environment variables.
google.generativeai: This is the library that interacts with Google's generative AI model to generate responses based on text input.
fitz (PyMuPDF): A Python binding for MuPDF that is used to open and read PDF files, extract text, images, etc.
streamlit: A web application framework used to create the user interface for the application. It allows users to upload PDFs and interact with the application.
3. API Key Configuration
python
Copy code
# Hardcoded API key (Not recommended for production)
api_key = "set your api key here"  # Replace with your actual API key

# Check if the API key is valid
if not api_key:
    st.error("API key is missing. Please hardcode the API key in the script.")
else:
    # Configure Generative AI API
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
The API key is hardcoded for this implementation (not recommended for production).
The key is checked before proceeding. If the key is missing, an error is shown to the user.
Note: In a production environment, you should avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys. Use environment variables or a secure key management service.

4. Generation Settings for the AI Model
python
Copy code
# Configure generation settings for the model
generation_config = {
    "temperature": 1.2,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "top_k": 50,
    "max_output_tokens": 8192,
    "response_mime_type": "text/plain",
}

# Initialize the GenerativeModel with your configuration
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    model_name="gemini-1.5-flash",
    generation_config=generation_config,
)
chat_session = model.start_chat(history=[])
Generation Configuration: Defines the settings for the AI model's response generation:
temperature: Controls the randomness of the response. A higher value (e.g., 1.2) results in more creative responses.
top_p, top_k: Control the sampling behavior for more coherent answers.
max_output_tokens: The maximum number of tokens (words/pieces of text) in the generated response.
response_mime_type: Specifies that the response should be in plain text.
Generative Model: The AI model (gemini-1.5-flash) is initialized with the specified configuration, and a new chat session is started.
5. PDF Text Extraction Function
python
Copy code
# Function to extract text from PDF
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file):
    text = ""
    pdf_document = fitz.open(stream=pdf_file, filetype="pdf")
    for page_num in range(pdf_document.page_count):
        page = pdf_document.load_page(page_num)
        text += page.get_text()  # Extracts text from the PDF page
    return text
extract_text_from_pdf: This function takes the uploaded PDF file and extracts the text content.
fitz.open: Opens the PDF file.
page.get_text(): Extracts the text content of each page.
page_count: Iterates through all pages in the PDF and accumulates the extracted text.
6. Streamlit UI Elements
python
Copy code
# Streamlit UI
st.title("PDF Question-Answer Assistant")
st.title: Sets the title of the application in the Streamlit UI.
python
Copy code
# Upload PDF section
uploaded_pdf = st.file_uploader("Upload a PDF file", type="pdf")
st.file_uploader: Displays a file upload widget to the user. It only accepts PDF files (type="pdf").
7. PDF Processing and Question Handling
python
Copy code
if uploaded_pdf:
    try:
        # Extract text from PDF
        pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf(uploaded_pdf.read())
        st.success("PDF uploaded and text extracted successfully!")
        
        # Input for questions
        question = st.text_input("Enter your question about the PDF content:")

        if question:
            input_text = f"Here is the text from the PDF:\n\n{pdf_text}\n\nQuestion: {question}"
            response = chat_session.send_message(input_text)
            response_text = response.text

            # Display the response
            st.write("AI Response:", response_text)

            # Save the conversation history
            chat_session.history.append({"role": "user", "parts": [question]})
            chat_session.history.append({"role": "model", "parts": [response_text]})

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"An error occurred while processing the PDF: {e}")
PDF Upload and Text Extraction: Once the PDF is uploaded, the text extraction function is called, and the extracted text is displayed to the user.
Question Input: A text input widget is displayed for the user to enter their question about the uploaded PDF content.
AI Model Interaction: The question is combined with the extracted PDF text and sent to the AI model for processing. The response is then displayed on the UI.
History Logging: The user’s question and the AI model’s response are appended to the chat history to maintain the conversation context.
Error Handling: If any error occurs during PDF extraction or the AI model interaction, it is caught and displayed to the user.

8. Error Handling
python
Copy code
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"An error occurred while processing the PDF: {e}")
Error Handling: If any exception occurs (e.g., issues with reading the PDF or interacting with the AI), it is caught and the error message is displayed to the user.
Conclusion
The PDF Question-Answer Assistant is a simple application built using Streamlit, PyMuPDF, and Google Generative AI. It allows users to upload a PDF, ask questions related to the document's content, and get answers powered by a generative AI model.

This solution can be expanded further by adding more features like:

Improved error handling for edge cases.
Support for more complex document formats (e.g., images, tables).
Enhanced performance through multi-threading or caching.
However, it's important to note that hardcoding sensitive information, like API keys, is not recommended in production environments. Instead, environment variables or secure key management services should be used.
